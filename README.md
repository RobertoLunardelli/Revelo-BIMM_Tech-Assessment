# Cypress Automation Project - Revelo 🚀

This project is a full end-to-end (E2E) automated test suite developed with Cypress to validate several functionalities of a web application.

## 📋 Project Overview

This automation covers critical scenarios such as:

- Form submission with required and optional fields
- Radio button selection and validation
- Checkbox tree navigation and selection
- Alerts and confirmation boxes validation
- Browser window management (new tabs and windows)

It follows best practices like:

- Organized folder structure (Page Objects and Commands separated)
- Dynamic test data generation using Faker
- Arrange / Act / Assert test pattern
- Custom Cypress Commands for reusability and maintainability
